### Regenerating Protobufs

Whenever you change `src/proto/loom.proto`, or `src/tests/tests.proto` you will need to regenerate
the corresponding `*_pb.js` by running:

```shell
# Mac / Linux
yarn proto
# Windows
yarn proto:win
```

The shell must be able to locate the `protoc` binary, which can be obtained from https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases
